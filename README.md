# GenyConnect
GenyConnect is a modern, cross-platform **secure tunneling client** and **VPN** designed for **high performance**, **privacy**, and **precise traffic control**.

It provides a robust orchestration layer for secure network engines, focusing on correctness, observability, and user experience rather than binding itself to any single protocol or implementation.

---

## Overview

GenyConnect enables users to establish and manage secure connections through structured server profiles and shareable configuration links. Runtime configurations are generated dynamically, connection lifecycles are supervised explicitly, and system state remains fully observable at all times.

The platform is intentionally **engine-agnostic**, allowing different tunneling backends to be integrated without altering user workflows or expected behavior.

## Key Capabilities

- **Clear operational visibility**  
  Live logs, real-time traffic statistics, and explicit connection-state reporting provide full transparency into network activity.

- **High-performance execution**  
  Lightweight and efficient by design, GenyConnect introduces minimal overhead and remains responsive under heavy traffic and sustained workloads.

- **Deterministic lifecycle management**  
  Predictable startup, clean shutdown, and safe reconnection logic prevent partial or undefined states.

- **Advanced traffic routing**  
  Fine-grained control over traffic flows, including:
  - whitelist-based routing
  - domain-level tunnel / direct / block rules
  - application- or process-based routing

- **Flexible tunneling modes**  
  Supports both application-level proxying and system-wide tunneling while maintaining a consistent control surface.

---

## Notes

- GenyConnect currently delivers a fully functional, production-ready **secure tunneling layer**.
- **Native VPN protocol support is planned** and will be introduced in future releases.
- The architecture is designed to accommodate VPN protocols without disrupting existing tunneling workflows or user experience.

---

## Future Notes

- GenyConnect is designed with a long-term vision to support the **Geny token ecosystem**.  
  In future iterations, this client may serve as an execution and control layer aligned with the Geny token’s economic and utility model.

- The architecture of GenyConnect is intentionally built to allow **integration with decentralized social protocols**.  
  As part of this vision, plans exist to coordinate and interoperate with **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}**.

- The goal of this direction is not to build a network client alone, but to evolve GenyConnect into an **intelligent connectivity layer** that can align with user identity, decentralized interaction, and token-based ecosystems.

- These capabilities will be introduced progressively, without disrupting the existing tunneling and VPN experience.
